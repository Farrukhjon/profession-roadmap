# Profession Roadmap - Ontological Representation - Knowledge Graphs - Semantic Network

_"...**Knowledge graphs are** a specific type of graph with an emphasis on `contextual understanding`.
Knowledge graphs are `interlinked sets of facts that describe real-world` entities,
events, or things and their interrelations in a human- and machine-understandable format."_ _**Knowledge Graphs** by Jesus Barrasa, Amy E. Hodler, Jim Webber_

_"...what transforms a graph into a knowledge graph is the application of an organizing `principle` that helps people and software to understand it.
Historically this has loftily been called `semantics`,
but we just think of it as making the `data smarter`."_ _**Building Knowledge Graphs** by Jesus Barrasa, Maya Natarajan, Jim Webber_

## Generate graphs and diagrams from
 - Run `compile.sh`
   - Compiles source dot files from the `src` directory
   - Results are generated in `target` directory
